  #### Question 62:
A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance.

lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
heighti is the height of the ith building.
You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.

The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...].
  Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, 
  which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends.
  Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] 
  is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]

boolean isUnique(string word) Returns true if either of the following conditions are met (otherwise returns false):

According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.

A string s matches a pattern if there is some bijective mapping of single characters to strings such that if each character in pattern is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is s. A bijective mapping means that no two characters map to the same string, and no character maps to two different strings.

  #### Question 151:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

  #### Question 152:
A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1 edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h))  are called minimum height trees (MHTs).

Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.

The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

  #### Question 154:
You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.

Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

  #### Question 159:
You are given an m x n grid grid of values 0, 1, or 2, where:

each 0 marks an empty land that you can pass by freely,
each 1 marks a building that you cannot pass through, and
each 2 marks an obstacle that you cannot pass through.
You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the shortest total travel distance. You can only move up, down, left, and right.

Return the shortest travel distance for such a house. If it is not possible to build such a house according to the above rules, return -1.

The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.

On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb.

Return the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.

A word's generalized abbreviation can be constructed by taking any number of non-overlapping and non-adjacent substrings and replacing them with their respective lengths.

For example, "abcde" can be abbreviated into:
"a3e" ("bcd" turned into "3")
"1bcd1" ("a" and "e" both turned into "1")
"5" ("abcde" turned into "5")
"abcde" (no substrings replaced)
However, these abbreviations are invalid:
"23" ("ab" turned into "2" and "cde" turned into "3") is invalid as the substrings chosen are adjacent.
"22de" ("ab" turned into "2" and "bc" turned into "2") is invalid as the substring chosen overlap.
Given a string word, return a list of all the possible generalized abbreviations of word. Return the answer in any order.

  #### Question 163:
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of lengths m and n respectively. nums1 and nums2 represent the digits of two numbers. You are also given an integer k.

Return an array of the k digits representing the answer.
