## Questions:
1.Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method to read n characters.
2.Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.
3.Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.
4.Given two strings s and t, return true if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return false.

5.A string s is said to be one distance apart from a string t if you can:

Insert exactly one character into s to get t.
Delete exactly one character from s to get t.
Replace exactly one character of s with a different character to get t.
6.You are given an inclusive range [lower, upper] and a sorted unique integer array nums, where all elements are in the inclusive range.

A number x is considered missing if x is in the range [lower, upper] and x is not in nums.

Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover every missing number exactly. That is, no element of nums is in any of the ranges, and each missing number is in one of the ranges.

Each range [a,b] in the list should be output as:

"a->b" if a != b
"a" if a == b 
7.Given an array of strings wordsDict and two different strings that already exist in the array word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
8.Design a data structure that will be initialized with a string array, and then it should answer queries of the shortest distance between two different strings from the array.

Implement the WordDistance class:

WordDistance(String[] wordsDict) initializes the object with the strings array wordsDict.
int shortest(String word1, String word2) returns the shortest distance between word1 and word2 in the array wordsDict.
9.Design a data structure that will be initialized with a string array, and then it should answer queries of the shortest distance between two different strings from the array.

Implement the WordDistance class:

WordDistance(String[] wordsDict) initializes the object with the strings array wordsDict.
int shortest(String word1, String word2) returns the shortest distance between word1 and word2 in the array wordsDict.
10.Given an array of strings wordsDict and two strings that already exist in the array word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Note that word1 and word2 may be the same. It is guaranteed that they represent two individual words in the list.
11.Given an integer n, return all the strobogrammatic numbers that are of length n. You may return the answer in any order.

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).
12.
